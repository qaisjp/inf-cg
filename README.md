UNN: s1620208

Name: Qais Patankar

Total: 95

Report feedback:
 Very good report, with detailed descriptions of every step. Good qualitative assessment of final result.

Implementation feedback:
 Very good effort. Matching the rendering resolution with the resolution of the real world image would have avoided the pixelated effect on shadows and objects. Reducing the saturation of the synthetic orange through tonemapping might have resulted to a slightly more realistic scene.
